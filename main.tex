\begin{abstract}
    Respiratory motion correction is beneficial in positron emission tomography. Different strategies for handling attenuation correction exist. In clinical practice, usually a single attenuation map is available, derived from CT in one respiratory state. This can introduce an unwanted bias (through misaligned anatomy) into the motion correction algorithm. This paper builds upon previous work which suggested that non-attenuation corrected data was suitable for motion correction, through the use of motion models, if time of flight data are available. Here, the previous work is expanded upon by incorporating attenuation correction in an iterative process. Non-attenuation corrected volumes are reconstructed using ordered subset expectation maximisation \& used as input for motion model estimation. A single attenuation map is then warped to the volumes, using the motion model, \& the volumes are attenuation corrected, after which another motion estimation \& correction cycle is performed. For validation, $4$-Dimensional Extended Cardiac Torso simulations are used, for one bed position, with a field of view including the base of the lungs \& the diaphragm. The output from the proposed method is evaluated against a non-motion corrected reconstruction of the same data using both a visual \& standardised uptake value analysis as well as a profiles volume. Results indicate that  motion correction of inter-respiratory cycle motion is possible with this method, while accounting for attenuation deformation. The implications for future research include the possibility of directly incorporating the motion model estimation into the reconstruction algorithm as well as also attempting to simultaneously estimate deformations for the attenuation map as well as the activity distribution.
